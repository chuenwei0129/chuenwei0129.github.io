This piece of HTML represents an article with a leading header that says "An article header" and a paragraph that contains the text "Some content". This is combined with CSS to style the page and JavaScript to add interactivity.
However, HTML doesn't let you create reusable templates. If you wanted to create a new page, you would need to copy and paste the above snippet and edit the header and content yourself. This isn't great if we have a lot of content on our site that shares a lot of similar layout. The smart people who created React also had similar complaints and invented the concept of Components -- JavaScript functions that return JSX -- to solve the code duplication problem.
