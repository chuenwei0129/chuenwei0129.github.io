## A year of 'almosts'

2020 is:

- about 9.5 times longer than a Rick Roll in seconds
- about 54 times longer than the number of minutes I listened to Spotify this year
- about how many contributions I made on GitHub this year
- roughly the amount of pages I've read this year
- almost a palindrome
